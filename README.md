# NSCH Project: Repeated Cross-Sectional Study 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data collected by the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) to determine the association between friendship development (FD) and bullying victimization (BV) amoung youth 12-17 years of age diagnosed with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within the United States. Association between FD and BV will be compared through the years 2018-2023 in order to determine the potential impacts of COVID-19 [i.e., pre (2018,2019), peak (2020,2021), and post-COVID (2022,2023)]. The association between FD and BV will be further examined after controlling for potential confounding variables including baseline outcome status, age, sex, family income, and neurobehavioral disorder management (i.e., behavioural therapy, medication).
