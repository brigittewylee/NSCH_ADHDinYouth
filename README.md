# NSCH Project: Repeated Cross-Sectional Study 

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data collected by the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) to determine the association between friendship development (FD) and bullying victimization (BV) amoung youth 12-17 years of age diagnosed with Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) within the United States. Association between FD and BV will be compared through the years 2018-2023 in order to determine the potential impacts of COVID-19 [i.e., pre (2018,2019), peak (2020,2021), and post-COVID (2022,2023)]. The association between FD and BV will be further examined after controlling for potential confounding variables including baseline outcome status, age, sex, family income, and neurobehavioral disorder management (i.e., behavioural therapy, medication). 

## Dataset Access and Ethics Approval 
Original datasets are publicly accessible and can be viewed through the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative (CAHMI) Data Resource Center (DRC) (https://www.childhealthdata.org/browse) or, downloaded from the United States Census Bureau (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.2023.html#list-tab-491554181). 

The University of Waterloo’s Office of Research Ethics does not require ethics review to analyze a public dataset that is freely available to download from the United States Census Bureau website (https://uwaterloo.ca/research/office-research-ethics/research-human-participants/pre-submission-and-training/human-research-guidelines-policies-and-resources/does-my-data-collection-activity-require-ethics-review).
